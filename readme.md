#### _{2 widgets to show room and staff availability}, {1/28/2017}_

#### By _**{Chris Underwood}**_

## Description

_{Vanilla JavaScript application that imports 2 JSON files via AJAX. One is for staff availability in the office and the other is for meeting room availability. }_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

Download the files and open index.html. As with all AJAX programs, you will need a webserver to run the app. I used Browser Sync which automatically reloads the webpage after each save. https://www.npmjs.com/package/browser-sync Once Browser Link is installed, go to folder where the application is saved and run browser-sync start --server --files "css/*.css, *.html" via the command line. The app should come up in the browser.

## Known Bugs

_{None that I am away of. }_
